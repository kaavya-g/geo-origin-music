# geo-origin-music
Music is one of the most soul-soothing art forms in the history of human evolution. The type and origin of music can hint at the social, political, and behavioral setting of society in a given period as art is nuanced and is often shaped by these factors. In this project, we investigated whether we could predict the geographical origin of music using its audio features.Our focus was on leveraging the distribution of music and the interrelations among various attributes using data mining techniques, which is generally referred to as geographical ethnomusicology. This is an interesting problem as it involves both regression and classification aspects to the target origin prediction.  

In  this  project  we  have  used  the  Geographical  Origin  of  Music  Data  from  the  UCI  Machine Learning Repository. The dataset was built from a personal collection of 1059 tracks covering 33 countries/areas. The music used is traditional. Any Western music is not included because its influence is global. The program MARSYAS was used to extract audio features from the wave files. The default MARSYAS settings in single vector format (68 features) to estimate the performance with basic timbal information covering the entire length of each track. All features were transformed to have a mean of 0, and a standard deviationof 1. The last two columns of the dataset are the latitude and longitude, representing the place of origin of the music. A second version of the data set also contains chromatic features which describe the  notes of  the scale being used, a  distinguishing  feature  in  geographical ethnomusicology.  This data set contains an additional 48 features making the total numberof features 116. We have only used the former data set because of strict time constraints. We  have  leveraged  various  Machine  Learning  models  and  techniques  to  build  dependable models that can predict the origin of music given its audio features.  We have trained our models  on  a  training  data  set  and  validated  the  results  using  a  separate  test  data. The first part of our project consists of data exploration to better understand the data followed by  feature selection. We  have  then  built  various  models,  tuned  the  hyperparameters  and validated the results. The major goal was to predict the geographical location of the music given by latitude and longitude.  We can also find trends in the data that are unbounded by countries alone, as we can expect, owing to the constantly evolving geography of the world. These trends were identified by suitable data mining techniques.
